# Palomino

Palomino was a extensive roleplay schema built off of a custom fork of Helix (https://github.com/nebulouscloud/helix) called pHelix (https://github.com/sildotdev/phelix). Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances with some co-founders, the project was halted.

#### Inventory Menu Concept Art

The image below is one of the first things I created for this project. It ended up becoming so popular that someone remade it in figma, and that remake was featured on some YouTube videos.

The Police Computer is achieved by running an external React web app using the React95 template. See here: https://github.com/sildotdev/palOS
The implementation in-game features PAUTH (https://github.com/sildotdev/pauth/) authentication and retrieving arrest records from PAPI (https://github.com/sildotdev/papi/).
