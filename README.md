# Palomino

Palomino was a extensive roleplay schema built off of a custom fork of Helix (https://github.com/nebulouscloud/helix) called pHelix (https://github.com/sildotdev/phelix). Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances with some co-founders, the project was halted.

The Police Computer is achieved by running an external React web app using the React95 template. See here: https://github.com/sildotdev/palOS
The implementation in-game features PAUTH (https://github.com/sildotdev/pauth/) authentication and retrieving arrest records from PAPI (https://github.com/sildotdev/papi/).
